# Practical Computing for Biologists
- A graduate seminar taught by Jason Ladner at Northern Arizona University, Fall semester 2018. 
- This is the primary repository for course materials, and will be updated regularly. 

### Course Description
As datasets continue to increase in complexity, computational analysis is becoming a routine part of scientific research. This is a hands-on training course that shows you how to use general computing tools to work more efficiently and effectively in the biological sciences. This course will cover a broad range of powerful and flexible tools including text file manipulation with regular expressions, interacting with a command line interface, basic shell scripting, programming in Python and R, interaction with remote devices, and basic graphical concepts.

### Learning Objectives
1. Students will become comfortable using computer science tools and programming techniques to enhance/improve data manipulation and analysis
2. Students will be able to perform the following tasks:
    - Edit/modify text files using regular expressions
    - Interact with a computer via a command line interface
    - Write custom Python analysis scripts
    - Generate figures using Python

### Required Text
Haddock, S. H. D. and Dunn, C. W. (2010). Practical Computing for Biologists. [Sinauer Associates](http://practicalcomputing.org)

Assigned reading **must** be completed prior to each class. This will allow us to minimize time spent in lectures and maximize hands-on time actively using the new tools being taught. 

### Grading
This seminar is pass/fail. There will not be graded assingments. However, **attendence and participation are required.**

### Useful Links
[Appendices](http://practicalcomputing.org/files/PCfB_Appendices.pdf) from the Practical Computing for Biologists book, which summarize frequently used commands.
